## 📘 Contents

This repository includes well-documented Jupyter notebooks covering:

- ✅ Introduction to PyTorch and environment setup  
- 🔢 Scalar, Vector, Matrix, and Higher-Dimensional Tensors  
- 🔵 Tensor attributes: `shape`, `dtype`, `device`, `requires_grad`  
- ✍️ Creating tensors: `tensor`, `arange`, `zeros`, `ones`, `rand`, `tensor_like`  
- ⚙️ Tensor operations: indexing, reshaping, basic math  
- 🔁 Conversion between NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors

## 🚀 Why Tensors Matter in Machine Learning

- Tensors are the foundational data structure in deep learning.  
- They enable high-performance computation on GPUs and TPUs.  
- Support automatic differentiation and gradient tracking.  
- Make batch operations and data parallelism easier to manage.
